# PS2 BlueLink 🔵🔗

**PS2 BlueLink** is a lightweight desktop utility designed to automate the preparation of USB drives for PlayStation 2 (OPL). It handles the "boring stuff" like finding Game IDs and extracting compressed archives so you can just plug and play.

## 📥 Download
You can find the latest standalone version in the **[Releases](https://github.com/DraxTube/PS2-BlueLink-/releases)** section. No installation required!

## ✨ Key Features
* **Smart Renaming:** Automatically finds the Game ID (e.g. `SLUS_211.94`) and renames the ISO for OPL.
* **Archive Ready:** Supports `.zip`, `.7z`, and `.rar` – it extracts the ISO and copies it in one go.
* **Fast & Safe:** Includes a "Smart Skip" feature that detects if a game is already on the USB to avoid redundant copies.
* **Visual Progress:** Real-time speed monitor and ETA.

## 🛠️ Requirements
* **Windows 10/11**
* For `.rar` support, ensure you have **WinRAR** or **7-Zip** installed on your system.

## 📖 Quick Start
1. Run `PS2BlueLink.exe`.
2. Select your folder with games and your USB drive.
3. Click **START TRANSFER** and wait for the "Operation Finished" message.
4. Your USB is now ready for your PS2!
